## Examples of how to use EOS smart contracts

This directory contains a number of examples showcasing various capabilities of
the `eos-rust` crate.

All examples can be executed with:

```
cargo run --example $name
```

A high level description of each example is:

* [`review`](review.rs) - a tiny smart contract, that affords to do manipulations
  with review (like create, read, update), should help see how to create and 
  initialize `eos-rust`.

If you've got an example you'd like to see here, please feel free to open an
issue. Otherwise if you've got an example you'd like to add, please feel free
to make a PR!
